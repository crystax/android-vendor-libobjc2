GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 1.4
===============================

This is the fifth official release of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.
libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support the features of Objective-C 2
for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C programs.  Highlights of this
release include:

- Support for the associated reference APIs introduced with OS X 10.6.  This
  allows storing arbitrary objects associated with another object.

- Concurrent, thread-safe, +initialize.  The runtime will now send +initialize
  messages to different classes concurrently in multiple threads, but still
  ensures that no class receives another message until it has returned from
  +initialize.  Exceptions can now safely propagate out of +initialize methods.

- Better hiding of local symbols.  Now the internal runtime functions are not
  visible from outside of the runtime.

- Dispatch table updates have been improved.  Category loading no longer
  triggers dtable creation and partial dtable updates are faster.  

- Improvements to the low memory profile.  Uses 5-10% less memory running Gorm,
  and now passes the entire GNUstep and EtoileFoundation test suites.  Build
  with [g]make low_memory=yes to enable this mode.  Note that the low memory
  profile trades some CPU time for memory usage, so don't use it for CPU-bound
  tasks.

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs, and a small number
of GCC APIs for legacy compatibility.

This library is based on the Étoilé Objective-C Runtime, an earlier research
prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance variables,
type-dependent dispatch, and object planes.  It is fully compatible with the
FSF's GCC Objective-C ABI and also implements a new ABI that is supported by
Clang and Étoilé's LanguageKit and is required for some of the newer features.

Although the runtime has been tested by several people, and is being used
extensively by the Étoilé project, it is entirely new (MIT licensed) code and
may still contain bugs.  If you come across any problems, please report them to
the GNUstep Developer mailing list <gnustep-dev@gnu.org>.
